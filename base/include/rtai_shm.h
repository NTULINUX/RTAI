 * @param size is the amount of required shared memory.
 *
 * @param suprt is the kernel allocation method to be used, it can be:
 * - USE_VMALLOC, use vmalloc;
 * - USE_GFP_KERNEL, use kmalloc with GFP_KERNEL;
 * - USE_GFP_ATOMIC, use kmalloc with GFP_ATOMIC;
 * - USE_GFP_DMA, use kmalloc with GFP_DMA.
 *
 * Since @c name can be a clumsy identifier, services are provided to
 * convert 6 characters identifiers to unsigned long, and vice versa.
 *
 * @see the functions nam2num() and num2nam().
 *
 * It must be remarked that only the very first call does a real allocation, 
 * any subsequent call to allocate with the same name from anywhere will just
 * increase the usage count and map the area to user space, or return the
 * related pointer to the already allocated space in kernel space. The function 
 * returns a pointer to the allocated memory, appropriately mapped to the memory
 * space in use. So if one is really sure that the named shared memory has been 
 * allocated already parameters size and suprt are not used and can be 
 * assigned any value.
