1.1.24 release notes

new features:
- GLOB_TILDE extension to glob
- non-stub catgets localization API, using netbsd binary catalog format
- posix_spawn file actions for [f]chdir (extension, pending future standard)
- secure_getenv function (extension)
- copy_file_range syscall wrapper (Linux extension)
- header-level support for new linux features in 5.2

performance:
- new fast path for lrint (generic C version) on 32-bit archs

major internal changes:
- functions involving time are overhauled to be time64-ready in 32-bit archs
- x32 uses the new time64 code paths to replace nasty hacks in syscall glue

compatibility & conformance:
- support for powerpc[64] unaligned relocation types
- powerpc[64] and sh sys/user.h no longer clash with kernel asm/ptrace.h
- select no longer modifies timeout on failure (or at all)
- mips64 stat results are no longer limited to 32-bit time range
- optreset (BSD extension) now has a public declaration
- support for clang inconsistencies in wchar_t type vs some 32-bit archs
- mips r6 syscall asm no longer has invalid lo/hi register clobbers
- vestigial asm declarations of __tls_get_new are removed (broke some tooling)
- riscv64 mcontext_t mismatch glibc's member naming is corrected

bugs fixed:
- glob failed to match broken symlinks consistently
- invalid use of interposed calloc to allocate initial TLS
- various dlsym symbol resolution logic errors
- semctl with SEM_STAT_ANY didn't work
- pthread_create with explicit scheduling was subject to priority inversion
- pthread_create failure path had data race for thread count
- timer_create with SIGEV_THREAD notification had data race getting timer id
- wide printf family failed to support l modifier for float formats

arch-specific bugs fixed:
- x87 floating point stack imbalance in math asm (i386-only CVE-2019-14697)
- x32 clock_adjtime, getrusage, wait3, wait4 produced junk (struct mismatches)
- lseek broken on x32 and mipsn32 with large file offsets
- riscv64 atomics weren't compiler barriers
- riscv64 atomics had broken asm constraints (missing earlyclobber flag)
- arm clone() was broken when compiled as thumb if start function returned
- mipsr6 setjmp/longjmp did not preserve fpu register state correctly
