+===================================
+The Interrupt Pipeline (aka I-pipe)
+===================================
+
+:Copyright: |copy| 2018: Philippe Gerum
+
+Purpose
+=======
+
+Using Linux as a host for lightweight software cores specialized in
+delivering very short and bounded response times has been a popular
+way of supporting real-time applications in the embedded space over
+the years.
+
+This design - known as the *dual kernel* approach - introduces a small
+real-time infrastructure which schedules time-critical activities
+independently from the main kernel. Application threads co-managed by
+this infrastructure still benefit from the ancillary kernel services
+such as virtual memory management, and can also leverage the rich GPOS
+feature set Linux provides such as networking, data storage or GUIs.
+
+Although the real-time infrastructure has to present specific driver
+stack and API implementations to applications, there are nonetheless
+significant upsides to keeping the real-time core separate from the
+GPOS infrastructure:
+
+- because the two kernels are independent, real-time activities are
+  not serialized with GPOS operations internally, removing potential
+  delays which might be induced by the non time-critical
+  work. Likewise, there is no requirement for keeping the GPOS
+  operations fine-grained and highly preemptible at any time, which
+  would otherwise induce noticeable overhead on low-end hardware, due
+  to the requirement for pervasive task priority inheritance and IRQ
+  threading.
+
+- the functional isolation of the real-time infrastructure from the
+  rest of the kernel code restricts common bug hunting to the scope of
+  the smaller kernel, excluding most interactions with the very large
+  GPOS kernel base.
+
+- with a dedicated infrastructure providing a specific, well-defined
+  set of real-time services, applications can unambiguously figure out
+  which API calls are available for supporting time-critical work,
+  excluding all the rest as being potentially non-deterministic with
+  respect to response time.
+
+To support such a *dual kernel system*, we need the kernel to exhibit
+a high-priority execution context, for running out-of-band real-time
+duties concurrently to the regular operations.
+
+.. NOTE:: The I-pipe only introduces the basic mechanisms for hosting
+such a real-time core, enabling the common programming model for its
+applications in user-space. It does *not* implement the real-time core
+per se, which should be provided by a separate kernel component.
+
+The issue of interrupt response time
+====================================
+
+The real-time core has to act upon device interrupts with no delay,
+regardless of the regular kernel operations which may be ongoing when
+the interrupt is received by the CPU.
+
+However, to protect from deadlocks and maintain data integrity, Linux
+normally hard disables interrupts around any critical section of code
+which must not be preempted by interrupt handlers on the same CPU,
+enforcing a strictly serialized execution among those contexts.
+
+The unpredictable delay this may cause before external events can be
+handled is a major roadblock for kernel components requiring
+predictable and very short response times to external events, in the
+range of a few microseconds.
+
+Therefore, there is a basic requirement for prioritizing interrupt
+masking and delivery between the real-time core and GPOS operations,
+while maintaining consistent internal serialization for the kernel.
+
+To address this issue, the I-pipe implements a mechanism called
+*interrupt pipelining* turns all device IRQs into NMIs, only to run
+NMI-safe interrupt handlers from the perspective of the regular kernel
+activities.
+
+Two-stage IRQ pipeline
+======================
+
+.. _pipeline
+Interrupt pipelining is a lightweight approach based on the
+introduction of a separate, high-priority execution stage for running
+out-of-band interrupt handlers immediately upon IRQ receipt, which
+cannot be delayed by the in-band, regular kernel work even if the
+latter serializes the execution by - seemingly - disabling interrupts.
+
+IRQs which have no handlers in the high priority stage may be deferred
+on the receiving CPU until the out-of-band activity has quiesced on
+that CPU. Eventually, the preempted in-band code can resume normally,
+which may involve handling the deferred interrupts.
+
+In other words, interrupts are flowing down from the out-of-band to
+the in-band interrupt stages, which form a two-stage pipeline for
+prioritizing interrupt delivery.
+
+The runtime context of the out-of-band interrupt handlers is known as
+the *head stage* of the pipeline, as opposed to the in-band kernel
+activities sitting on the *root stage*::
+
+                    Out-of-band                 In-band
+                    IRQ handlers()            IRQ handlers()

+
+A software core may base its own activities on the head stage,
+interposing on specific IRQ events, for delivering real-time
+capabilities to a particular set of applications. Meanwhile, the
+regular kernel operations keep going over the root stage unaffected,
+only delayed by short preemption times for running the out-of-band
+work.
+
+.. NOTE:: Interrupt pipelining is a partial implementation of [#f2]_,
+          in which an interrupt *stage* is a limited form of an
+          operating system *domain*.
+
+Virtual interrupt flag
+----------------------
+
+.. _flag:
+As hinted earlier, predictable response time of out-of-band handlers
+to IRQ receipts requires the in-band kernel work not to be allowed to
+delay them by masking interrupts in the CPU.
+
+However, critical sections delimited this way by the in-band code must
+still be enforced for the *root stage*, so that system integrity is
+not at risk. This means that although out-of-band IRQ handlers may run
+at any time while the *head stage* is accepting interrupts, in-band
+IRQ handlers should be allowed to run only when the root stage is
+accepting interrupts too.
+
+So we need to decouple the interrupt masking and delivery logic which
+applies to the head stage from the one in effect on the root stage, by
+implementing a dual interrupt control mechanism.
+
+To this end, a software logic managing a virtual interrupt flag (aka
+*IPIPE_STALL_FLAG*) is introduced by the interrupt pipeline between
+the hardware and the generic IRQ management layer. This logic can mask
+IRQs from the perspective of the regular kernel work when
+:c:func:`local_irq_save`, :c:func:`local_irq_disable` or any
+lock-controlled masking operations like :c:func:`spin_lock_irqsave` is
+called, while still accepting IRQs from the CPU for immediate delivery
+to out-of-band handlers.
+
+The head stage protects from interrupts by disabling them in the CPU's
+status register, while the root stage disables interrupts only
+virtually. A stage for which interrupts are disabled is said to be
+*stalled*. Conversely, *unstalling* a stage means re-enabling
+interrupts for it.
+
+Obviously, stalling the head stage implicitly means disabling
+further IRQ receipts for the root stage too.
+
+Interrupt deferral for the *root stage*
+---------------------------------------
+
+.. _deferral:
+.. _deferred:
+When the root stage is stalled by setting the virtual interrupt flag,
+the occurrence of any incoming IRQ which was not delivered to the
+*head stage* is recorded into a per-CPU log, postponing its actual
+delivery to the root stage.
+
+The delivery of the interrupt event to the corresponding in-band IRQ
+handler is deferred until the in-band kernel code clears the virtual
+interrupt flag by calling :c:func:`local_irq_enable` or any of its
+variants, which unstalls the root stage. When this happens, the
+interrupt state is resynchronized by playing the log, firing the
+in-band handlers for which an IRQ was set pending.
+
+::
+   /* Both stages unstalled on entry */
+   local_irq_save(flags);
+   <IRQx received: no out-of-band handler>
+       (pipeline logs IRQx event)
+   ...
+   local_irq_restore(flags);
+       (pipeline plays IRQx event)
+            handle_IRQx_interrupt();
+
+If the root stage is unstalled at the time of the IRQ receipt, the
+in-band handler is immediately invoked, just like with the
+non-pipelined IRQ model.
+
+.. NOTE:: The principle of deferring interrupt delivery based on a
+          software flag coupled to an event log has been originally
+          described as "Optimistic interrupt protection" in [#f1]_.
+
+Device interrupts virtually turned into NMIs
+--------------------------------------------
+
+From the standpoint of the in-band kernel code (i.e. the one running
+over the *root* interrupt stage) , the interrupt pipelining logic
+virtually turns all device IRQs into NMIs, for running out-of-band
+handlers.
+
+.. _re-entry:
+For this reason, out-of-band code may generally **NOT** re-enter
+in-band code, for preventing creepy situations like this one::
+
+   /* in-band context */
+   spin_lock_irqsave(&lock, flags);
+      <IRQx received: out-of-band handler installed>
+         handle_oob_event();
+            /* attempted re-entry to in-band from out-of-band. */
+            in_band_routine();
+               spin_lock_irqsave(&lock, flags);
+               <DEADLOCK>
+               ...
+            ...
+         ...
+   ...
+   spin_unlock irqrestore(&lock, flags);
+
+Even in absence of any attempt to get a spinlock recursively, the
+outer in-band code in the example above is entitled to assume that no
+access race can occur on the current CPU while interrupts are
+masked. Re-entering in-band code from an out-of-band handler would
+invalidate this assumption.
+
+In rare cases, we may need to fix up the in-band kernel routines in
+order to allow out-of-band handlers to call them. Typically, atomic_
+helpers are such routines, which serialize in-band and out-of-band
+callers.
+
+Virtual/Synthetic interrupt vectors
+-----------------------------------
+
+.. _synthetic:
+.. _virtual:
+The pipeline introduces an additional type of interrupts, which are
+purely software-originated, with no hardware involvement. These IRQs
+can be triggered by any kernel code. So-called virtual IRQs are
+inherently per-CPU events.
+
+Because the common pipeline flow_ applies to virtual interrupts, it
+is possible to attach them to out-of-band and/or in-band handlers,
+just like device interrupts.
+
+.. NOTE:: virtual interrupts and regular softirqs differ in essence:
+          the latter only exist in the in-band context, and therefore
+          cannot trigger out-of-band activities.
+
+Virtual interrupt vectors are allocated by a call to
+:c:func:`ipipe_alloc_virq`, and conversely released with
+:c:func:`ipipe_free_virq`.
+
+For instance, a virtual interrupt can be used for triggering an
+in-band activity on the root stage from the head stage as follows::
+
+  #include <linux/ipipe.h>
+
+  static void virq_handler(unsigned int virq, void *cookie)
+  {
+        do_in_band_work();
+  }
+
+  void install_virq(void)
+  {
+     unsigned int virq;
+     ...
+     virq = ipipe_alloc_virq();
+     ...
+     ipipe_request_irq(ipipe_root_domain, virq, virq_handler,
+		       handler_arg, NULL);
+  }
+
+An out-of-band handler can schedule the execution of
+:c:func:`virq_handler` like this::
+
+  ipipe_post_irq_root(virq);
+
+Conversely, a virtual interrupt can be handled from the out-of-band
+context::
+
+  static void virq_oob_handler(unsigned int virq, void *cookie)
+  {
+        do_oob_work();
+  }
+
+  void install_virq(void)
+  {
+     unsigned int virq;
+     ...
+     virq = ipipe_alloc_virq();
+     ...
+     ipipe_request_irq(ipipe_head_domain, virq, virq_oob_handler,
+		       handler_arg, NULL);
+  }
+
+Any in-band code can trigger the immediate execution of
+:c:func:`virq_oob_handler` on the head stage as follows::
+
+  ipipe_post_irq_head(virq);
+
+Pipelined interrupt flow
+------------------------
+
+.. _flow:
+When interrupt pipelining is enabled, IRQs are first delivered to the
+pipeline entry point via a call to the generic
+:c:func:`__ipipe_dispatch_irq` routine. Before this happens, the event
+has been propagated through the arch-specific code for handling an IRQ::
+
+    asm_irq_entry
+       -> irqchip_handle_irq()
+          -> ipipe_handle_domain_irq()
+             -> __ipipe_grab_irq()
+                -> __ipipe_dispatch_irq()
+                -> irq_flow_handler()
+                <IRQ delivery logic>
+
+Contrary to the non-pipelined model, the generic IRQ flow handler does
+*not* call the in-band interrupt handler immediately, but only runs
+the irqchip-specific handler for acknowledging the incoming IRQ event
+in the hardware.
+
+.. _Holding interrupt lines:
+If the interrupt is either of the *level-triggered*, *fasteoi* or
+*percpu* type, the irqchip is given a chance to hold the interrupt
+line, typically by masking it, until either of the out-of-band or
+in-band handler have run. This addresses the following scenario, which
+happens for a similar reason while an IRQ thread waits for being
+scheduled in, requiring the same kind of provision::
+
+    /* root stage stalled on entry */
+    asm_irq_entry
+       ...
+          -> __ipipe_dispatch_irq()
+             ...
+                <IRQ logged, delivery deferred>
+    asm_irq_exit
+    /*
+     * CPU allowed to accept interrupts again with IRQ cause not
+     * acknowledged in device yet => **IRQ storm**.
+     */
+    asm_irq_entry
+       ...
+    asm_irq_exit
+    asm_irq_entry
+       ...
+    asm_irq_exit
+
+IRQ delivery logic
+------------------
+
+If an out-of-band handler exists for the interrupt received,
+:c:func:`__ipipe_dispatch_irq` invokes it immediately, after switching
+the execution context to the head stage if not current yet.
+
+Otherwise, if the execution context is currently over the root stage
+and unstalled, the pipeline core delivers it immediately to the
+in-band handler.
+
+In all other cases, the interrupt is only set pending into the per-CPU
+log, then the interrupt frame is left.
+
+Alternate scheduling
+====================
+
+The I-pipe promotes the idea that a *dual kernel* system should keep
+the functional overlap between the kernel and the real-time core
+minimal. To this end, a real-time thread should be merely seen as a
+regular task with additional scheduling capabilities guaranteeing very
+low response times.
+
+To support such idea, the I-pipe enables kthreads and regular user
+tasks to run alternatively in the out-of-band execution context
+introduced by the interrupt pipeline_ (aka *head* stage), or the
+common in-band kernel context for GPOS operations (aka *root* stage).
+
+As a result, real-time core applications in user-space benefit from
+the common Linux programming model - including virtual memory
+protection -, and still have access to the regular Linux services for
+carrying out non time-critical work.
+
+Task migration to the head stage
+--------------------------------
+
+Low latency response time to events can be achieved when Linux tasks
+wait for them from the out-of-band execution context. The real-time
+core is responsible for switching a task to such a context as part of
+its task management rules; the I-pipe facilitates this migration with
+dedicated services.
+
+The migration process of a task from the GPOS/in-band context to the
+high-priority, out-of-band context is as follows:
+
+1. :c:func:`__ipipe_migrate_head` is invoked from the migrating task
+   context, with the same prerequisites than for calling
+   :c:func:`schedule` (preemption enabled, interrupts on).
+
+.. _`in-band sleep operation`:
+2. the caller is put to interruptible sleep state (S).
+
+3. before resuming in-band operations, the next task picked by the
+   (regular kernel) scheduler on the same CPU for replacing the
+   migrating task fires :c:func:`ipipe_migration_hook` which the
+   real-time core should override (*__weak* binding). Before the call,
+   the head stage is stalled, interrupts are disabled in the CPU. The
+   root execution stage is still current though.
+
+4. the real-time core's implementation of
+   :c:func:`ipipe_migration_hook` is passed a pointer to the
+   task_struct descriptor of the migrating task. This routine is expected
+   to perform the necessary steps for taking control over the task on
+   behalf of the real-time core, re-scheduling its code appropriately
+   over the head stage. This typically involves resuming it from the
+   `out-of-band suspended state`_ applied during the converse migration
+   path.
+
+5. at some point later, when the migrated task is picked by the
+   real-time scheduler, it resumes execution on the head stage with
+   the register file previously saved by the kernel scheduler in
+   :c:func:`switch_to` at step 1.
+
+Task migration to the root stage
+--------------------------------
+
+Sometimes, a real-time thread may want to leave the out-of-band
+context, continuing execution from the in-band context instead, so as
+to:
+
+- run non time-critical (in-band) work involving regular system calls
+  handled by the kernel,
+
+- recover from CPU exceptions, such as handling major memory access
+  faults, for which there is no point in caring for response time, and
+  therefore makes no sense to duplicate in the real-time core anyway.
+
+.. NOTE: The discussion about exception_ handling covers the last
+   point in details.
+
+The migration process of a task from the high-priority, out-of-band
+context to the GPOS/in-band context is as follows::
+
+1. the real-time core schedules an in-band handler for execution which
+   should call :c:func:`wake_up_process` to unblock the migrating task
+   from the standpoint of the kernel scheduler. This is the
+   counterpart of the :ref:`in-band sleep operation <in-band sleep
+   operation>` from the converse migration path. A virtual_ IRQ can be
+   used for scheduling such event from the out-of-band context.
+
+.. _`out-of-band suspended state`:
+2. the real-time core suspends execution of the current task from its
+   own standpoint. The real-time scheduler is assumed to be using the
+   common :c:func:`switch_to` routine for switching task contexts.
+
+3. at some point later, the out-of-band context is exited by the
+   current CPU when no more high-priority work is left, causing the
+   preempted in-band kernel code to resume execution on the root
+   stage. The handler scheduled at step 1 eventually runs, waking up
+   the migrating task from the standpoint of the kernel.
+
+4. the migrating task resumes from the tail scheduling code of the
+   real-time scheduler, where it suspended in step 2. Noticing the
+   migration, the real-time core eventually calls
+   :c:func:`__ipipe_reenter_root` for finalizing the transition of the
+   incoming task to the root stage.
+
+Binding to the real-time core
+-----------------------------
+
+.. _binding:
+The I-pipe facilitates fine-grained per-thread management from the
+real-time core, as opposed to per-process. For this reason, the
+real-time core should at least implement a mechanism for turning a
+regular task into a real-time thread with extended capabilities,
+binding it to the core.
+
+The real-time core should inform the kernel about its intent to
+receive notifications about that task, by calling
+:c:func::`ipipe_enable_notifier` when such task is current.
+
+For this reason, the binding operation is usually carried out by a
+dedicated system call exposed by the real-time core, which a regular
+task would invoke.
+
+.. NOTE:: Whether there should be distinct procedures for binding
+	  processes *and* threads to the real-time core, or only a
+	  thread binding procedure is up to the real-time core
+	  implementation.
+
+Notifications
+-------------
+
+Exception handling
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+.. _exception
+If a processor exception is raised while the CPU is busy running a
+real-time thread in the out-of-band context (e.g. due to some invalid
+memory access, bad instruction, FPU or alignment error etc), the task
+may have to leave such context immediately if the fault handler is not
+protected against out-of-band interrupts, and therefore cannot be
+properly serialized with out-of-band code.
+
+The I-pipe notifies the real-time core about incoming exceptions early
+from the low-level fault handlers, but only when some out-of-band code
+was running when the exception was taken. The real-time core may then
+take action, such as reconciling the current task's execution context
+with the kernel's expectations before the task may traverse the
+regular fault handling code.
+
+.. HINT:: Enabling debuggers to trace real-time thread involves
+          dealing with debug traps the former may poke into the
+          debuggee's code for breakpointing duties.
+
+The notification is issued by a call to :c:func:`__ipipe_notify_trap`
+which in turn invokes the :c:func:`ipipe_trap_hook` routine the
+real-time core should override for receiving those events (*__weak*
+binding). Interrupts are **disabled** in the CPU when
+:c:func:`ipipe_trap_hook` is called.::
+
+     /* out-of-band code running */
+     *bad_pointer = 42;
+        [ACCESS EXCEPTION]
+	   /* low-level fault handler in arch/<arch>/mm */
+           -> do_page_fault()
+	      -> __ipipe_notify_trap(...)
+	         /* real-time core */
+	         -> ipipe_trap_hook(...)
+		    -> forced task migration to root stage
+	   ...
+           -> handle_mm_fault()
+
+.. NOTE:: handling minor memory access faults only requiring quick PTE
+          fixups should not involve switching the current task to the
+          in-band context though. Instead, the fixup code should be
+          made atomic_ for serializing accesses from any context.
+
+System calls
+~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+A real-time core interfaced with the kernel via the I-pipe may
+introduce its own set of system calls. From the standpoint of the
+kernel, this is a foreign set of calls, which can be distinguished
+unambiguously from regular ones based on an arch-specific marker.
+
+.. HINT:: Syscall numbers from this set might have a different base,
+	  and/or some high-order bit set which regular syscall numbers
+	  would not have.
+
+If a task bound to the real-time core issues any system call,
+regardless of which of the kernel or real-time core should handle it,
+the latter must be given the opportunity to:
+
+- perform the service directly, possibly switching the caller to
+  out-of-band context first would the request require it.
+
+- pass the request downward to the normal system call path on the root
+  stage, possibly switching the caller to in-band context if needed.
+
+If a regular task (i.e. *not* known from the real-time core [yet])
+issues any foreign system call, the real-time core is given a chance
+to handle it. This way, a foreign system call which would initially
+bind a regular task to the real-time core would be delivered to the
+real-time core as expected (see binding_).
+
+The I-pipe intercepts system calls early in the kernel entry code,
+delivering them to the proper handler according to the following
+logic::
+
+     is_foreign(syscall_nr)?
+	    Y: is_bound(task)
+	           Y: -> ipipe_fastcall_hook()
+		   N: -> ipipe_syscall_hook()
+            N: is_bound(task)
+	           Y: -> ipipe_syscall_hook()
+		   N: -> normal syscall handling
+
+:c:func:`ipipe_fastcall_hook` is the fast path for handling foreign
+system calls from tasks already running in out-of-band context.
+
+:c:func:`ipipe_syscall_hook` is a slower path for handling requests
+which might require the caller to switch to the out-of-band context
+first before proceeding.
+
+Kernel events
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+The last set of notifications involves pure kernel events which the
+real-time core may need to know about, as they may affect its own task
+management. Except for IPIPE_KEVT_CLEANUP which is called for *any*
+exiting user-space task, all other notifications are only issued for
+tasks bound to the real-time core (which may involve kthreads).
+
+The notification is issued by a call to :c:func:`__ipipe_notify_kevent`
+which in turn invokes the :c:func:`ipipe_kevent_hook` routine the
+real-time core should override for receiving those events (*__weak*
+binding). Interrupts are **enabled** in the CPU when
+:c:func:`ipipe_kevent_hook` is called.
+
+The notification hook is given the event type code, and a single
+pointer argument which relates to the event type.
+
+The following events are defined (include/linux/ipipe_domain.h):
+
+- IPIPE_KEVT_SCHEDULE(struct task_struct *next)
+
+  sent in preparation of a context switch, right before the memory
+  context is switched to *next*.
+
+- IPIPE_KEVT_SIGWAKE(struct task_struct *target)
+
+  sent when *target* is about to receive a signal. The real-time core
+  may decide to schedule a transition of the recipient to the root
+  stage in order to have it handle that signal asap, which is commonly
+  required for keeping the kernel sane. This notification is always
+  sent from the context of the issuer.
+
+- IPIPE_KEVT_SETAFFINITY(struct ipipe_migration_data *p)
+
+  sent when p->task is about to move to CPU p->dest_cpu.
+
+- IPIPE_KEVT_EXIT(struct task_struct *current)
+
+  sent from :c:func:`do_exit` before the current task has dropped the
+  files and mappings it owns.
+
+- IPIPE_KEVT_CLEANUP(struct mm_struct *mm)
+
+  sent before *mm* is entirely dropped, before the mappings are
+  exited. Per-process resources which might be maintained by the
+  real-time core could be released there, as all threads have exited.
+
+  ..NOTE:: IPIPE_KEVT_SETSCHED is deprecated, and should not be used.
+
+Prerequisites
+=============
+
+The interrupt pipeline requires the following features to be available
+from the target kernel:
+
+- Generic IRQ handling
+- Clock event abstraction
+
+Implementation
+==============
+
+The following kernel areas are involved in interrupt pipelining:
+
+- Generic IRQ core
+
+  * IRQ flow handlers
+
+    Generic flow handlers acknowledge the incoming IRQ event in the
+    hardware by calling the appropriate irqchip-specific
+    handler. However, the generic flow_ handlers do not immediately
+    invoke the in-band interrupt handlers, but leave this decision to
+    the pipeline core which calls them, according to the pipelined
+    delivery logic.
+
+- Arch-specific bits
+
+  * CPU interrupt mask handling
+
+    The architecture-specific code which manipulates the interrupt
+    flag in the CPU's state register
+    (i.e. arch/<arch>/include/asm/irqflags.h) is split between real
+    and virtual interrupt control:
+
+    + the *hard_local_irq* level helpers affect the hardware state in
+      the CPU.
+
+    + the *arch_* level helpers affect the virtual interrupt flag_
+      implemented by the pipeline core for controlling the root stage
+      protection against interrupts.
+
+    This means that generic helpers from <linux/irqflags.h> such as
+    :c:func:`local_irq_disable` and :c:func:`local_irq_enable`
+    actually refer to the virtual protection scheme when interrupts
+    are pipelined, implementing interrupt deferral_ for the protected
+    in-band code running over the root stage.
+
+  * Assembly-level IRQ, exception paths
+
+    Since interrupts are only virtually masked by the in-band code,
+    IRQs can still be taken by the CPU although they should not be
+    visible from the root stage when they happen in the following
+    situations:
+
+    + when the virtual protection flag_ is raised, meaning the root
+      stage does not accept IRQs, in which case interrupt _deferral
+      happens.
+
+    + when the CPU runs out-of-band code, regardless of the state of
+      the virtual protection flag.
+
+    In both cases, the low-level assembly code handling incoming IRQs
+    takes a fast exit path unwinding the interrupt frame early,
+    instead of running the common in-band epilogue which checks for
+    task rescheduling opportunities and pending signals.
+
+    Likewise, the low-level fault/exception handling code also takes a
+    fast exit path under the same circumstances. Typically, an
+    out-of-band handler causing a minor page fault should benefit from
+    a lightweight PTE fixup performed by the high-level fault handler,
+    but is not allowed to traverse the rescheduling logic upon return
+    from exception.
+
+- Scheduler core
+
+  * CPUIDLE support
+
+    The logic of the CPUIDLE framework has to account for those
+    specific issues the interrupt pipelining introduces:
+
+    - the kernel might be idle in the sense that no in-band activity
+    is scheduled yet, and planning to shut down the timer device
+    suffering the C3STOP (mis)feature.  However, at the same time,
+    some out-of-band code might wait for a tick event already
+    programmed in the timer hardware controlled by some out-of-band
+    code via the timer_ interposition mechanism.
+
+    - switching the CPU to a power saving state may incur a
+    significant latency, particularly for waking it up before it can
+    handle an incoming IRQ, which is at odds with the purpose of
+    interrupt pipelining.
+
+    Obviously, we don't want the CPUIDLE logic to turn off the
+    hardware timer when C3STOP is in effect for the timer device,
+    which would cause the pending out-of-band event to be
+    lost.
+
+    Likewise, the wake up latency induced by entering a sleep state on
+    a particular hardware may not always be acceptable.
+
+    Since the in-band kernel code does not know about the out-of-band
+    code plans by design, CPUIDLE calls :c:func:`ipipe_cpuidle_control`
+    to figure out whether the out-of-band system is fine with entering
+    the idle state as well.  This routine should be overriden by the
+    out-of-band code for receiving such notification (*__weak*
+    binding).
+
+    If this hook returns a boolean *true* value, CPUIDLE proceeds as
+    normally. Otherwise, the CPU is simply denied from entering the
+    idle state, leaving the timer hardware enabled.
+
+    ..CAUTION:: If some out-of-band code waiting for an external event
+    cannot bear with the latency that might be induced by the default
+    architecture-specific CPU idling code, then CPUIDLE is not usable
+    and should be disabled at build time.
+
+  * Kernel preemption control (PREEMPT)
+
+    :c:func:`__preempt_schedule_irq` reconciles the virtual interrupt
+    state - which has not been touched by the assembly level code upon
+    kernel entry - with basic assumptions made by the scheduler core,
+    such as entering with interrupts disabled. It should be called by
+    the arch-specific assembly code in replacement of
+    :c:func:`preempt_schedule_irq`, from the call site dealing with
+    kernel preemption upon return from IRQ or system call.
+
+- Timer management
+
+  * Timer interposition
+
+.. _timer:
+    The timer interposition mechanism is designed for handing over
+    control of the hardware tick device in use by the kernel to an
+    out-of-band timing logic. Typically, a real-time co-kernel would
+    make good use of this feature, for grabbing control over the timer
+    hardware.
+
+    Once some out-of-band logic has grabbed control over the timer
+    device by calling :c:func:`ipipe_select_timers`, it can install
+    its own out-of-band handlers using :c:func:`ipipe_timer_start`.
+    From that point, it must carry out the timing requests from the
+    in-band timer core (e.g. hrtimers) in addition to its own timing
+    duties.
+
+    In other words, once the interposition is set up, the
+    functionality of the tick device is shared between the in-band and
+    out-of-band contexts, with only the latter actually programming
+    the hardware.
+
+    This mechanism is based on the clock event abstraction (`struct
+    clock_event_device`). Clock event devices which may be controlled
+    by this way need their drivers to be specifically adapted for such
+    use:
+
+    + the interrupt handler receiving tick IRQs must be check with
+    :c:func:`clockevent_ipipe_stolen` whether they actually control
+    the hardware. A non-zero return from this routine means that it
+    does not, and therefore should skip the timer acknowledge
+    code, which would have run earlier in that case.
+
+- Generic locking & atomic
+
+  * Generic atomic ops
+
+.. _atomic:
+    The effect of virtualizing interrupt protection must be reversed
+    for atomic helpers in <asm-generic/{atomic|bitops/atomic}.h> and
+    <asm-generic/cmpxchg-local.h>, so that no interrupt can preempt
+    their execution, regardless of the stage their caller live
+    on.
+
+    This is required to keep those helpers usable on data which
+    might be accessed concurrently from both stages.
+
+    The usual way to revert such virtualization consists of delimiting
+    the protected section with :c:func:`hard_local_irq_save`,
+    :c:func:`hard_local_irq_restore` calls, in replacement for
+    :c:func:`local_irq_save`, :c:func:`local_irq_restore`
+    respectively.
+
+  * Hard spinlocks
+
+    The pipeline core introduces one more spinlock type:
+
+    + *hard* spinlocks manipulate the CPU interrupt mask, and don't
+      affect the kernel preemption state in locking/unlocking
+      operations.
+
+      This type of spinlock is useful for implementing a critical
+      section to serialize concurrent accesses from both in-band and
+      out-of-band contexts, i.e. from root and head stages. Obviously,
+      sleeping into a critical section protected by a hard spinlock
+      would be a very bad idea.
+
+      In other words, hard spinlocks are not subject to virtual
+      interrupt masking, therefore can be used to serialize with
+      out-of-band activities, including from the in-band kernel
+      code. At any rate, those sections ought to be quite short, for
+      keeping latency low.
+
+- Drivers
+
+  * IRQ chip drivers
+
+    .. _irqchip:
+    irqchip drivers need to be specifically adapted for supporting the
+    pipelined interrupt model. The irqchip descriptor gains additional
+    handlers:
+
+    + irq_chip.irq_hold is an optional handler called by the pipeline
+      core upon events from *level-triggered*, *fasteoi* and *percpu*
+      types. See Holding_ interrupt lines.
+
+      When specified in the descriptor, irq_chip.irq_hold should
+      perform as follows, depending on the hardware acknowledge logic:
+
+          + level   ->  mask[+ack]
+          + percpu  ->  mask[+ack][+eoi]
+          + fasteoi ->  mask+eoi
+
+      .. CAUTION:: proper acknowledge and/or EOI is important when
+                   holding a line, as those operations may also
+                   decrease the current interrupt priority level for
+                   the CPU, allowing same or lower priority
+                   out-of-band interrupts to be taken while the
+                   initial IRQ might be deferred_ for the root stage.
+
+    + irq_chip.irq_release is the converse operation to
+      irq_chip.irq_hold, releasing an interrupt line from the held
+      state.
+
+      The :c:func:`ipipe_end_irq` routine invokes the available
+      handler for releasing the interrupt line. The pipeline core
+      calls :c:func:`irq_release` automatically for each IRQ which has
+      been accepted by an in-band handler (`IRQ_HANDLED` status). This
+      routine should be called explicitly by out-of-band handlers
+      before returning to their caller.
+
+    `IRQCHIP_PIPELINE_SAFE` must be added to `struct irqchip::flags`
+    member of a pipeline-aware irqchip driver.
+
+    .. NOTE:: :c:func:`irq_set_chip` will complain loudly with a
+              kernel warning whenever the irqchip descriptor passed
+              does not bear the `IRQCHIP_PIPELINE_SAFE` flag and
+              CONFIG_IPIPE is enabled.
+
+- Misc
+
+  * :c:func:`printk`
+
+    :c:func:`printk` may be called by out-of-band code safely, without
+    encurring extra latency. The output is delayed until the in-band
+    code resumes, and the console driver(s) can handle it.
+
+  * Tracing core
+
+    Tracepoints can be traversed by out-of-band code safely. Dynamic
+    tracing is available to a kernel running the pipelined interrupt
+    model too.

+         immediately, without any header or preparation whatsoever,
