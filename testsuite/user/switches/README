This directory checks task switching time for hard real time processes (user
space environment), by repeated use of suspend/resumes and sem_wait/sem_signal.
In case you are slicing microsecs note that the results are related to
relativily heavily loaded task queues, i.e. 30 tasks, both for the semaphore 
waiting and suspended tasks lists. Moreover, as usual for user space, they 
include full FPU support by default.
