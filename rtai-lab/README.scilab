RTAI-Lab supports now 3 versions of Scilab:

scilab-4.1.2
scicoslab-4.3
scilab-5.1.1

Installing files for scilab-4.1.2
=================================

1) move in the folder "scilab/macros"
2) check the macros "SCILAB_VERSION" and "SCILAB_DIR" in the Makefile
3) launch "make install" as superuser
4) launch "make user" for each user to create the .Scilab/scilab-4.1.2/.scilab file


Installing files for scicoslab-gtk-4.3
======================================

1) move in the folder "scicoslab/macros"
2) check the macros "SCILAB_VERSION" and "SCILAB_DIR" in the Makefile
3) launch "make install" as superuser
4) launch "make user" for each user to create the .Scilab/4.3/.scilab file


Installing files for scilab-5.1.1
=================================

1) move in the folder "scilab5"
2) check the macros "SCILAB_VERSION" and "SCILAB_DIR" in the Makefile
3) If you want static libraries in the executable RT task you can launch
      "make install as superuser"
   If you prefer shared libraries you can launch
      "make install_shared" as superuser
4) launch "make user" for each user to create the .Scilab/scilab-5.1.1/.scilab file

Many thanks to Holger Nahrstaedt for implementing the template Makefile for 
shared libraries!

Users with static libraries need liblapack.a and libblas.a installed in their PC!

To be tested:
Users with Scilab-5.1 and static libraries should remove "-lblas -llapack" from the 
SCI/share/scilab/contrib/RTAI/RT_templates/rtai.mak file

User with Scilab-5.1 an shared libraries should remove the line 
"-lscicall_scilab" and the "\" in previous line
from the SCI/share/scilab/contrib/RTAI/RT_templates/rtai.mak file
